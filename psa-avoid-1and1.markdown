<p>Just take my word for it: don’t use 1and1 internet. Ever. It’s not worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: About 5 minutes after I wrote this, I realized how hopeless this sounds… Hover.com offers great, simple Domain management services. I will be transferring all of my domains over to them ASAP :)</p>
